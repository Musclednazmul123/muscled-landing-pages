                <p>
                  Before taking a deep dive into landing pages let´s first cover
                  the basics of PPC. PPC or Paid per clicks, is an advertising
                  strategy that allows you to reach valuable leads and potential
                  customers interested in your business. These ads appear at the
                  top of the search results, right above the organic listings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  PPC ads are a fantastic way of attracting valuable leads that
                  are interested in your business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to begin using PPC ads, you first need to assign the
                  keywords for your page. The keywords will then trigger your ad
                  to appear in relevant search results. Long tail keywords
                  (which are three or more words) will help reach more qualified
                  leads towards your page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After you have chosen your keywords, you will have to bid for
                  your ads placement. You will set a maximum bid (in this case
                  the amount of money you are willing to pay per click on your
                  ad). This amount is flexible and can be changed at any moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your ad´s placement will be determined by both your bid and
                  quality score. Once your placement is confirmed, you will
                  launch your campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can run PPC ad´s on different social media platforms as
                  well, not just google. The ad´s will appear in the users
                  newsfeed. It's a great way to directly reach new leads and
                  potential customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Social media ad´s are seamlessly integrated into a user's news
                  feed. By combining both PPC and social media ads, you will
                  only pay when someone clicks on your ad. The money invested in
                  only going towards valuable leads and potential clients
                  interested in your products and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We'll go deeper on these landing pages at a later point. But
                  for now focus on why it's important to have a landing page for
                  your PPC and social media ads.

                  You can't just depend on SEO (search engine optimization) and
                  online advertising to increase your site's traffic. Converting
                  thaat traffic into sales is a completely different thing.
                  That's why having landing page PPC services is key to your
                  business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The role of the landing page is to convert a visitor to stay
                  and use your site, be it purchasing one of your products or
                  even sharing your page in online communities for others to
                  view. Instead of dropping your viewers directly on your
                  homepage where they may get lost and not know what to do next,
                  you redirect them to a highly targeted landing page that leads
                  them to the next step in your sales process.
                </p>

                  own an outdoor recreation company and you are currently
                  running a Google Ads campaign that targets searches related to
                  outdoor hobbies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make a clear example, you should think of your landing
                  pages in terms of continuity. For example you
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you don't have a landing page potential customers who
                  clicked on the ad seeking more information for camping
                  supplies would end up on your homepage. Given the breadth of
                  products and supplies for outdoor activities the customer then
                  needs to figure out how to navigate your website until he
                  reaches the section related to camping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is already too much work for most people, and it will
                  result in poor conversion rates. When a potential customer
                  clicks on your advertisement, they’re more inclined to make a
                  purchase if they’re presented with the information, price, and
                  so on right away.

                  Landing pages structure your data and make it more accessible.
                  It will be impossible for your website to be optimized for
                  improved user metrics if everything is directed to your
                  homepage.

                  A single modification on your website impacts everyone who
                  visits it. Increasing the conversion rate for one demographic
                  may reduce the rate of another.

                  a complex social media landing page with a strong call to

                  These landing pages are designed to be viral on internet
                  forums and social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook. It
                  may be an engaging blog article, an educational resource, or a
                  piece of breaking news that gets people talking. You know
                  you’re looking at the best landing page designs if they

                  A good social media landing site must have content that is
                  compelling, relevant, and useful. Social media landing pages
                  that don't have one of these three things must be redesigned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users are more inclined to take note and share a page with
                  useful content. Internet users don’t want to lose a page that
                  helped them before, so most popular social network landing
                  sites have content that allows users to still access them
                  later. That’s why social media landing pages are different due
                  to the fact that they want to turn people into fans instead of
                  persuading them to buy, unlike PPC landing pages.

                <p>
                  Unlike PPC landing pages, social media landing pages must also
                  be keyword-specific and lead to other pages on your site. The
                  more indexable they are, the more people will find them.

                  A landing page needs to deliver a focused experience for your
                  viewers. It is expected that your goal should be to persuade
                  them to make a purchase, be it a product or service, and it
                  loses its edge the moment you offer other things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Decide on the only item that will be sold on your landing
                  page. For example, if your landing page was made to sell
                  gardening tools, people would get confused if they clicked on
                  your advertisement and found a house for sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Concentrating on a single product or service will allow you to
                  get the best results from your PPC and social media marketing.

                  It’s normal to invest a lot of time in making sure that your
                  landing page will be excellent. You want it to not only
                  attract attention but also reflect your company’s brand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Branding is an important aspect of PPC. You can still get
                  clicks and have no converts, but not all hope is lost. This
                  will pay off in the long run when people need to buy the
                  product or avail of the service you provide. If you’ve
                  established your brand well, they’ll favor it over your
                  competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is why your landing pages need to be memorable. Keep a
                  simple yet eye-catching design. Pick the colors and typefaces
                  that will suit your business best. Your style should match
                  what your company is supposed to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consistency is key. Help your audience become more familiar
                  with your brand.

                  Returning to our gardening tool company, setting your headline
                  to be “Gardening Tools for Sale” might not work for your
                  target audience. On the other hand, a title like “Greenify
                  Your Garden with this Amazing Set of Tools” has a higher
                  chance of attracting attention. People who do want to
                  “greenify” their gardens will most likely check what you
                  offer.
                </p>
                <p>Remember that your leads are built on catchy headlines</p>

                  People don’t want to face a wall of text. Other than boosting
                  engagement, the use of visuals on your landing page will point
                  your users to where you’ll want them to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Still, you don’t want it to be overbearing. Try to limit
                  yourself to a single photo or a video. You don’t want your
                  audience to get confused and lose sight of the purpose of your
                  landing page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can’t go wrong with photos, especially if you’re selling
                  something. It’s the best and simplest way to let your future
                  customers see how your product works in action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can also show how dependable your company is by showing
                  how confident your people are in their uniforms. You can also
                  rely on photos to point users to the product you’re offering;
                  this can help focus their attention on the most important
                  content in your page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can’t also go wrong with videos if you have the resources
                  to produce them. Videos boost landing page conversions by 86
                  percent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Videos are by far the best way to keep your audience on your
                  landing page. It's fantastic for branding, especially when you
                  can deliver most of the information that your users need
                  without having them navigate around the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The longer your audience stays on your landing page, the more
                  likely it is that they will choose your company and convert
                  themselves into customers.

            headingSize="small"
          >
            <>
                <p>
                  Having a call to action, or CTA, means the difference between
                  someone moving forward and forgetting about your site and them
                  remembering it. You need to create an effective CTA to make
                  those users stay and even return when they need to get your
                  product or avail your services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is your first and last chance to tell your audience what
                  to do. And if you’re convincing enough, this might turn your
                  newfound leads into sales. You need to be upfront about it. A
                  generic call to action will be ignored. You need to inform
                  your viewers what will happen if they click on that button.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Don’t settle for “Click here to download immediately” or
                  “Click here!” Use specific CTAs like “Get your free guide
                  now!” or “Learn how to code today!”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your audience needs to understand what they’re going to get.
                  They need to be fully aware of what you’re offering them. This
                  is why you should only sell one product or service on your
                  landing page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An excellent CTA will get you the hottest leads for your
                  company. You need them to be as effective as they can be.

            <>
                <p>
                  You need to demonstrate why your product is the best option.
                  The trust signals on your page will reinforce that thought and
                  give the impression that your company really is the best
                  alternative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Testimonials, awards, and accolades are the most common ones
                  you can use. If your company won an award, add that to the
                  landing page. You should also not shy away from client
                  testimonials that speak to the quality of your product or
                  service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can obtain particular client testimonials that speak to
                  the quality of your product or service. Testimonials help to
                  validate the fact that others have had a great experience with
                  your product or service. It contributes to the development of
                  confidence in your company.

                  You should know that your landing page will be accessed by
                  users on their mobile phones. Make sure that your landing page

                  Your website needs to have a responsive design. It guarantees

            <>
                <p>
                  It’s normal for businesses to have forms on their landing
                  pages to collect information from their audience. If you feel
                  the need to have one, make sure to keep it short and
                  straightforward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People will feel like their time is wasted on a lengthy form.
                  You’re going to risk losing leads if your form is too long.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most businesses will only request a first name, last name, and
                  email address. These details are sufficient for you to begin
                  contacting that lead. You can get more useful information
                  later on by running an email marketing campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By keeping your forms brief, you will encourage more people to
                  fill them out and share their information with you. This is
                  still a valuable lead.

                    Your landing page will be abandoned if it fails to capture
                    the target audience. Most users will not have the time to
                    test your credibility. In a snap, they will know if they can
                    trust you based on the design of your landing page. They
                    will also scoff and leave your landing pages alone if the
                    content you’ve shown is different from the branding that you
                    wanted to establish. Your landing pages and marketing
                    materials must be strong, clear, and brief to turn users
                    into fans or customers. At the very least, it should look
                    professional instead of out of place. All the best-designed
                    landing pages have incorporated the components we’ve

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Landing page design services typically comprise designing,
                  developing, testing, and launching a landing page where the
                  traffic from ads is directed to. Landing page design services
                  boost a website’s conversion rates through ad campaigns, email
                  marketing, and many more.

                <h4 className="text-2xl">How much does it usually cost?</h4>
                <p>
                  The price varies depending on the design of your page, the
                  number of pages that need to be made, and the landing page
                  design firm. Businesses will typically invest $75 to $3000 per
                  landing page.
