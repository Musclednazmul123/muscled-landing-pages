          Paid social media ads are an excellent way to increase your D2C
          company's visibility on social media platforms. Social algorithms have
          made it more difficult to reach and engage consumers in their news
          feeds organically. However, with paid advertisements, such as the
          examples above, you can immediately increase awareness about the
          product and your brand. <br />
          <br />
